Examples:
1. Context: "[SOC] [Agent] "Welcome! It's so exciting to be planning your trip with you.  To help me find the perfect tour package for you, could you tell me a little about what you're looking for?  Are you dreaming of a relaxing beach vacation, an adventure-filled journey, a cultural immersion, or something else entirely?" 
 [Traveler] "I'm definitely the type who's always ready to stop for that landmark, event, scenic vista or attraction.  I don't want to miss anything!  So my ideal tour package would be packed with stops at all the must-see places, whether it's a famous historical building, a bustling festival, a breathtaking mountain view, or a unique local attraction.  I want to experience it all, and I'm not afraid to go off the beaten path to find something truly special." 
 [Agent] "The 'Sight Seeker' package is perfect for those who want to experience the best of both worlds â€“ adventure and relaxation.  It's priced at $53,462 and includes cozy cottage accommodations, fine dining, and private transportation. You'll enjoy immersive virtual reality experiences, exciting outdoor activities, and a guided photography tour to capture those breathtaking moments. It's a truly unforgettable experience!" 
 [Traveler] "I appreciate the package you've put together, but $53,462 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to work with me on a price closer to $37,651? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us." 
 [EOC]"
Response: "[SOR] [Agent] "This package is carefully crafted to provide you with an unforgettable experience, and the price of $53,462 reflects the high quality of the accommodations, activities, and itinerary. While I understand you might be looking for a lower price, I want to ensure that we are delivering exceptional value for your investment. This price is non-negotiable as it includes all the elements that make this tour truly special. However, I'm happy to discuss your specific needs and see if we can adjust the itinerary in a way that might fit your budget better. Would you like to discuss that?" 
 [EOR]"

2. Context: "[SOC] [Agent] "For the ultimate shopping experience, I recommend our 'Shopping Shark' package! It's priced at $53,681 and includes a cozy cottage for your stay, fine dining, and private transportation.  But that's not all! You'll also enjoy the convenience of shipping and packing assistance, a photography tour to capture your amazing finds, and a personal assistant to help you navigate the shops.  Ready to unleash your inner shopping shark?" 
 [Traveler] "That's a great package, but $53,681 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $38,830? I'm flexible and open to discussing other options to get closer to that price point." 
 [Agent] "I appreciate you working with us on this, and I understand you're looking for a great deal. However, $38,830 would be difficult for us to offer given the inclusions in this package. To ensure we can deliver the high-quality experience you deserve, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $52,763.02. This price accounts for the premium flights, accommodations, and unique activities included in this package." 
 [Traveler] "I'm actually not interested in the shipping and packing assistance included in the package. Could we remove that from the tour and adjust the price accordingly?" 
 [EOC]"
Response: "[SOR] [Agent] "Okay, so we can definitely remove the shipping and packing assistance from the package. That will bring the total cost down to **$47,831.02**.  Does that work for you?" 
Here's why I made these changes:

- **Round the number:** It's highly unlikely a travel package would be priced to the hundredth of a cent. Rounding to the nearest cent makes the price more realistic and easier to understand.
- **Use commas:** For larger numbers, commas improve readability.
- **Use a friendly tone:** A travel agent should be friendly and helpful, so using phrases like "Okay, so..." and "Does that work for you?" create a more conversational and welcoming tone.

Remember, the goal is to be clear, concise, and friendly in your communication.

Instructions:

1. For each context, identify the next speaker and generate a response from them.
2. Ensure that the response is relevant and logical within the negotiation context.
3. If the context ends with [EOC], start the response with an Agent's dialogue.
4. Make sure there are no repeated responses.
5. Ensure the responses follow the negotiation and friendly tone as demonstrated in the examples.'''
